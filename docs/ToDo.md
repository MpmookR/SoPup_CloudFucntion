## ✅ New API Endpoints Added:

### Vaccination Management:

- `PUT /dogs/:dogId/vaccinations` - Update vaccination dates
- `POST /dogs/:dogId/mode-switch` - Switch dog mode (puppy ↔ social)

### Behavior Management:

- `PUT /dogs/:dogId/behavior` - Update behavior profile (social mode only)
  - `isNeutered: boolean`
  - `behavior: DogBehavior` (play style, environment, triggers)
  - `healthStatus: HealthStatus` (flea/worming treatment dates)

## 🔄 Complete Flow:

1. User adds vaccinations → Backend saves them
2. Frontend checks vaccination status → Shows "Switch to Social?" alert
3. User switches mode → Backend validates & switches
4. Frontend prompts behavior setup → User completes profile
5. User can now participate in social matching
